# IdeaMaester
Python module for managing ideas, projects, history and notes.

IdeaMaester is a way to add, remove, edit and manage ideas.

Ideas often turn into projects, but first they have to be captured easily so as not to be forgotten.

IdeaMaester is a Python module for quickly adding ideas and then tracking them as they become projects.

To run IdeaMaester, navigate to the file containing the Python module, open a command line prompt 
and enter py ideamaester.py.  A GUI will open. Enter -h in the Action text box to see the list of 
actions that can be entered.  The GUI window will close and the list of actions will appear in the
command prompt window.  To enter a different action, repeat the py ideamaester.py command.

I know this is clunky, but it is a work in progress.  A better solution using JavaScript 6 is in progress,
but you are welcome to use and/or extend the Python module, feel free and share your improvements on 
GitHub.
